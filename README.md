# TV Data

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is it?

This is a practice application I made to learn React. It uses [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to show top-rated or popular shows, search for a specific show and view information on that show. The highlight is the episode rating chart, showing the trend in episode ratings for a given season.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
